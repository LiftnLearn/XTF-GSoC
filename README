% Xen Test Framework

This is a framework for creating microkernel-based tests of Xen, and a suite
of tests.  Tests are performed by the microkernel, with a single test (or
related set) per domain, with common setup, logging and reporting, designed
with "ease of automation" in mind for the entire suite of tests.

Tests for more generic areas are build multiple times into different
microkernels, to test the same functionality from different types of virtual
machine.

## The framework consists of:

* Nothing (yet)

## TODO List:

* More introductory text
* Entry points for 32 and 64bit PV and HVM guests
* Hypercall infrastructure
* PV console driver
* Common reporting framework
* Tests
